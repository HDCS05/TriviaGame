Link often travels through Hyrule, defeating creatures, evil forces, and the series' primary antagonist, Ganon, while attempting to save Princess Zelda and Hyrule.",

						"Although it looks like an unimpressive keyboard-like box, the Commodore 64 was incredibly popular.   More C64s have been sold than any other single computer system, even to this day. That's about 17 million systems, according to the Commodore 1993 Annual Report.",
						"A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer.  Considered by some to be a father of the computer, Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's analytical engine.",
						"The terabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The prefix tera represents the fourth power of 1000, and means 1012 in the International System of Units (SI), and therefore one terabyte is one trillion (short scale) bytes. The unit symbol for the terabyte is TB. 1 TB = 1000000000000bytes = 1012bytes = 1000gigabytes.  A related unit, the tebibyte (TiB), using a binary prefix, is equal to 10244 bytes. One terabyte is about 0.9095 TiB. Despite the introduction of these standardized binary prefixes, the terabyte is still also commonly used in some computer operating systems, primarily Microsoft Windows, to denote 1099511627776 (10244 or 240) bytes for disk drive capacity.",
						"In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company.",
						"ENIAC was developed and built by the U.S. Army for the purpose of calculating ballistic firing tables by emulating electronically a hand-operated mechanical calculator.  It used a 10-digit decimal system rather than the binary system used by modern computers. It could not store programs, and conditional branching, a basic function of all modern computers, involved clumsy manual programming using wires and plugs.",

						"A non-impact printer produces text and images without even touching the paper. An ink-jet printer is a non-impact printer because it just sprays ink onto paper to produce text and images.",

						"A computer programming language consisting of binary or hexadecimal instructions that a computer can respond to directly.",
						"The letter E is the most frequently typed letter in the English language and indeed in most European languages.
